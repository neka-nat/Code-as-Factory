Stage Small Objects - Surface-driven small-object placement (Stage 7)
========================================================================

Runs AFTER Stage 6 (stage6_geometry). Replaces the old "Stage 4 add small
items everywhere" approach with a surface-aware pipeline:

  1. Plane Discovery (rule-based): walk DETAILED_GEOMETRY from Stage 6,
     detect placement planes (table tops, cabinet tops, open-shelf layers,
     seat surfaces) with world-space size / center / orientation.

  2. Open-vs-closed furniture filter: only enumerate internal shelves of
     furniture whose object_type is in an open-furniture whitelist.

  3. LLM placement (per parent object, image-grounded): ask the LLM to
     decide which small objects to put on each plane, returning plane-local
     UV positions + bbox sizes.

  4. Code generation: append `create_box` / `create_cylinder` calls for the
     new small objects to the end of the Stage 6 geometry_output.py. The
     output file can be rendered directly in Blender.

The module is intentionally self-contained so it can be invoked as a CLI
without the rest of the pipeline, which makes iteration fast.

Usage:
    cd agent_utils
    python stage7_small_objects.py \
        --image ../agent_input/room.png \
        --geometry-json pipeline_output/stage6_geometry/geometry_progress.json \
        --base-code   pipeline_output/stage6_geometry/geometry_output.py \
        --output-dir  pipeline_output/stage7_small_objects

P1 scope: plane types = {top, shelf, seat}. The "floor_near" plane type is
intentionally deferred to a later phase.

    # v3 (2026-05-02): Stage 4 wall-decor plane synthesis
    # ============================================================
    # Stage 6 deliberately skips Stage 4 wall-mounted objects (they stay
    # as simple bbox in the rendered scene). That means floating shelves /
    # wall cabinets / spice racks never enter DETAILED_GEOMETRY, so the
    # regular PlaneFinder finds 0 planes on them and 0 small objects get
    # placed. The two methods below patch that:
    #
    #   _load_stage4_wall_object_geoms  -- read Stage 4 wall_objects.json
    #     and parse each Wall_* `create_box(...)` call out of self.base_code
    #     to recover (location, dim, rotation).
    #
    #   _synthesize_wall_decor_planes   -- whitelist filter via the
    #     stage5_describe object_type, compute the world-space TOP face of
    #     each whitelisted wall item (handles rotations like (pi/2, 0, *)
    #     correctly via 8-corner AABB), and emit a Plane object. Also
    #     injects a single-part DETAILED_GEOMETRY-style entry into
    #     self.detailed_geometry so downstream methods that iterate it
    #     (e.g. occupant detection, nearby-bbox payload) keep working.
    #
    # NOTE: pure decorations (wall art, mirror, clock, sconce, mounted TV,
    # pot rack, hook rail) are filtered out by WALL_DECOR_BLACKLIST_TYPES
    # — there is no usable surface on those.
